OUR SOFTWARE WILL DO THE FOLLOWING:
1.create table
	1.Key Constraint
	2.Entity Integrity Constraint
2.select col1,[col2,..] from mytab[,mytab2] where <condition>
	In condition,LHS operand is an attribute and RHS attribute should be a constant(string or integer)
3.insert into table_name values ('value1','value2',...)
	During insertion,we check for key and entity integrity constraints
4.delete from table_name where <condtion>
	In condition,LHS operand is an attribute and RHS attribute should be a constant(string or integer)
	
	
ASSUMPTIONS:
PK - datatype is implicitly taken as string
Only one condition in where clause

CODE FLOW:
1.Create:
   1.create1 will be called when 'c' is seen as first character of string.
   2.In this,table pointer is found 
   3.Table pointer and remaining parameters are passed on to actual create function.

2.Insert:
   1.insert1 is called on seeing character 'i'
   2.In this,table pointer is found
   3.Table pointer and remaining parameters are passed on to actual insert function.

3.Select:
    1.select1 will be called when 's' is seen as first character of string.
    2.Then pi1 is called,from that sigma1 is called and from that cross1 is called if two tables are given.
    
4.Delete:
    1.delete1 is called on seeing character 'd'
    2.Then satisfy function is called to find rows that satisfy given condition
    3.Now delete function is called that actually deletes the satisfied rows.
